# Cloud Run Preview Access

The production preview service is public so anyone can open it directly in a browser. Application-level authentication continues to protect user-specific data and actions.

## Service Details

- GCP project: `bond-calculator-pl`
- Region: `europe-central2`
- Cloud Run service: `obligacje-calculator`
- Public service URL: `https://obligacje-calculator-ji72nqwtea-lm.a.run.app`

Open the service URL directly. No Google Cloud account, proxy, or Cloud Run Invoker role is required for browser access.

## Health Checks

Run directly against the public URL:

```bash
curl https://obligacje-calculator-ji72nqwtea-lm.a.run.app/api/health
curl https://obligacje-calculator-ji72nqwtea-lm.a.run.app/api/readiness
```

Expected deployment contract:

- `/api/health`: `200`
- `/api/readiness`: `200` only when runtime configuration, database
  connectivity, required tables, and every reviewed migration hash are present
- OAuth may be deferred only with the explicit preview exception documented by
  the verifier; it does not establish authenticated-preview readiness

For the same smoke checks against the deployed service, run:

```bash
pnpm ops:verify-prod -- --allow-missing-oauth
```

The verifier checks:

- `/api/health`
- `/`
- `/single-calculator`
- `/api/calculation-defaults`
- `/api/readiness`

`--allow-missing-oauth` is valid only while Google OAuth is intentionally not configured. The database readiness check must still pass.

The readiness endpoint is dependency-aware but cannot prove a deployed state
from this repository. Record a redacted `ops:verify-prod` result, revision, and
authenticated workspace smoke in the private-preview evidence log before
claiming operational readiness.

After a deploy or rollback, pass the expected Cloud Run revision when checking
traffic routing:

```bash
pnpm ops:verify-prod -- --allow-missing-oauth --expected-revision obligacje-calculator-00042-abc
```

The verifier fails if that revision is not receiving 100 percent of service
traffic. Deploys also pass `--expected-image` so the ready service is checked
against the commit-SHA image built by the workflow.

To inspect the active Cloud Run revision without printing secret values, run:

```bash
pnpm ops:cloud-run-status
```

The command prints the service URL, latest ready revision, deployed image, traffic split, and whether each runtime environment variable is set.

## Local Production-Image Check

Before changing Docker, Cloud Run flags, or deployment workflows, run the final
image locally:

```bash
task preflight
task prod:container
task smoke:prod-container
```

The production Compose profile starts `app-prod` on `http://localhost:8080`
against local Postgres. The smoke command checks `/`, `/single-calculator`,
`/api/health`, and `/api/calculation-defaults`, including content type when CI
runs the same gate.

## GitHub Actions Deployment Secrets

The manual `Deploy Cloud Run` workflow requires these repository secrets:

- `DATABASE_URL`
- `AUTH_SECRET`
- `SYNC_SECRET`

Optional until Google OAuth is configured:

- `AUTH_GOOGLE_ID`
- `AUTH_GOOGLE_SECRET`

The workflow fails before deployment if the required secrets are missing, so it cannot silently overwrite Cloud Run with empty runtime values.

## CI/CD Flow

Use `dev` as the integration branch for ongoing work. Use `main` as the deployable branch.

Recommended flow:

1. branch from `dev` for focused changes
2. merge completed batches back into `dev`
3. open a PR from `dev` to `main` when the batch is ready
4. wait for CI to pass on `main`
5. run `pnpm deploy:prod` to dispatch the manual `Deploy Cloud Run` workflow from `main`

CI runs on pushes to both `dev` and `main`, and on pull requests. Production deploys are guarded so they only run from `main`.

Recommended GitHub branch protection:

- `main`: require pull request reviews, require CI `quality`, `build`, and `browser-smoke`, block force pushes, block direct pushes except emergency admin fixes.
- `dev`: require CI `quality`, `build`, and `browser-smoke`, allow feature-branch PR merges, block force pushes.
- Production environment: require manual approval before `Deploy Cloud Run` and `Rollback Cloud Run`.

## Manual Deploy

From an authenticated GitHub CLI session, dispatch the protected deployment workflow:

```bash
pnpm deploy:prod
gh run watch
```

The command does not deploy from the local machine. It starts the existing GitHub Actions
workflow on `main`, where release checks, OIDC authentication, production environment rules,
and post-deploy verification still apply.

In GitHub:

1. open `Actions`
2. select `Deploy Cloud Run`
3. choose `Run workflow`
4. select branch `main`

The deploy workflow:

- runs `pnpm check:release` before building the image
- builds and pushes immutable commit-SHA and `latest` image tags
- uses GitHub Actions cache for Docker layers
- deploys the public Cloud Run service
- labels the revision with the commit and GitHub run
- captures the latest ready Cloud Run revision
- runs production smoke checks with `pnpm ops:verify-prod`,
  including image and 100 percent revision traffic checks for the just-deployed
  image and revision
- writes the deployed image, revision, and service URL to the workflow summary

## Rollback

List recent revisions:

```bash
gcloud run revisions list \
  --project bond-calculator-pl \
  --region europe-central2 \
  --service obligacje-calculator
```

Then run the GitHub `Rollback Cloud Run` workflow and provide the target revision name. The workflow routes 100 percent of traffic to that revision and runs the same production verification checks with `--expected-revision`.
